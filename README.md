## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this, i came across a minor issue. The img element had a whitespace between it and the section element, after trying all i could and  making researches, i realized the error was from the fact that img elements are inline-block elements and all i had to do was make it a block level element. After applying that to the code, it worked and the whitespace was gone.

Also practiced a bit more with the box-shadow property.

Also with the padding property, I came to understand that it affects the width of the container. They might be some way to override this but at the moment i have no idea about that.

### Continued development

I'll keep practicing and expanding my knowledge.

Still to begin courses on Javascript but I'd love to see how well I'd do with it.
